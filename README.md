# ls4bun
*A Lightweight Server for Bun*

ls4bun is designed to be a minimal and secure overlay to bun. It offers simplified routings like static routes. It includes a secure deserialization of the body in requests and an optional validation system of input and output schemas. Finally it integrates a system of middlewares.

It is currently in development.

## Roadmap

### Router
- [X] OK

### Security
- [ ] Include something like helmet (maybe Elysia Helmet)
- [X] Extract safely JSON from body
- [X] Add schema check of input in POST
- [X] Add schema check of output in order to validate everything was OK

### Tests
- [ ] Add test coverage (WIP)

### Documentation
- [ ] Write documentation (WIP)
- [ ] Complete this README
- [ ] Add examples (input schema and output schema are missing)
- [ ] Explain how middlewares are used
- [ ] Explain how to use server reload on file change
- [ ] Explain how to export this server as a module
- [ ] Add SonarCloud score in this file
- [ ] Explain why suretype vs zod or ajv
- [ ] Explain how use extracted body
- [ ] Explain middlewares, how to set it and safe extract is added each time in first step

### Other
- [ ] Add server reload on file change
- [ ] Standardize output request for routes handlers
- [ ] Add SonarCloud evaluation
- [ ] Add watcher for hot reload when exposed folders change
- [X] Add SonarCloud
- [ ] Test to export as a model
- [ ] Remove source in main branch (automation)
